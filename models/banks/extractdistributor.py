extractdistributor.py
  Chooses function/method for calling depending upon which bank function/method calling it related.
This is because report extracts are not standardized, each one has its own. Consider this an experimental sketch.

TO-DO: it is needed for system to have an interface-like approach that is assymetric by now.
  Strategy to-try:
  1 the 'mounting' process, so to say, should be the following:
  1-1  choose bank (by bank3letter)
  1-2  choose refmonth range

Because data finding from textfiles is different by bank, a method with the same name (conventioned)
  might be called dynamically (ie, either by eval() or by a handler() (ie, handler followed by ())

Initial sketch: it's in commands.show.to_corretc_list_triple_rends_from_db.py
